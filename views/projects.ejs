Medlingual is partnering with Harvard's Phillips Brooks House Association (PBHA) to run and volunteer in Chinatown Citizenship, a program where volunteers teach courses in U.S. history and government to Chinatown immigrants to support them in the naturalization process. While many of the tutors speak Mandarin or Cantonese, Chinese-speaking ability is not required - there are courses that are taught in English.

Medlingual volunteers can work with Boston Partners in Education as part of two programs. 1) Academic Mentor Program: Support English Language Learners (ELL) in the Boston Public Schools. You will work one-on-one or a small group of 2-4 students for an hour a week during the school day (minimum time commitment), helping them with both academic subjects and personal growth. These matches will be made based on your preferences such as location, availability, subject matter, grade level, and your choice of one-on-one vs. small group work. 2) Volunteer Recruitment Material Translation--translate flyers (~250 words) or materials for BPE as needed.

This semester, Medlingual is providing instruction in medical interpreting by supporting students who wish to self-study the required material. Fill out the form below to receive study materials on medical interpretation in the core areas of Anatomy/Physiology, Interpreter Ethics/Code of Conduct, and Medical Terminology/Role Play. Besides providing these materials, we will also host several on-campus sessions during which students will practice roleplaying as interpreters.
